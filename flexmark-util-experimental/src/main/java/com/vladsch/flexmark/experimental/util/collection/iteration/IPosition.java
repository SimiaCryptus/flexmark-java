/**
 * Represents a position in the list at the given index and with a span of 0 or 1 elements.
 * <p>
 * Add/remove operations affect the index and span of this position depending on the anchor type of the position.
 * <p>
 * Once the span becomes 0, no modifications to the list can change it to span 1 element.
 * <p>
 * {@link PositionAnchor#CURRENT} - tracks a specific element at index when the position is instantiated.
 * Adding elements before the position will shift the range down in the list.
 * Removing elements before the position will shift the range up in the list.
 * Removing elements which include the position's index will set its span to 0.
 * The position is always available for adding/removing next/previous elements. The
 * current element is only available when span is 1.
 * <p>
 * {@link PositionAnchor#PREVIOUS} - tracks the previous element to the position from which it was instantiated.
 * The span will be 0 if no previous element existed when it was instantiated (ie. at position 0)
 * or was removed later.
 * <p>
 * The index of this position reflects the position in the list previous to the position from which
 * it was instantiated and the index is valid if span is 1 or index is &gt;0. Relative offset &lt;0 will be increased
 * by 1 if span is 0 to reflect removal of previous element.
 * <p>
 * This anchor position type is used for iterating positions in reverse since it ignores
 * insertions into the list immediately before the current position.
 * <p>
 * {@link PositionAnchor#NEXT} - tracks the next element to the position from which it was instantiated.
 * The span will be 0 if no next element existed when it was instantiated (ie. at end of the list)
 * or was removed later.
 * <p>
 * The index of this position reflects the position in the list next to the position from which
 * it was instantiated and the index is valid if span is 1 or index is &lt;list.size().
 * Relative offset &gt;0 will be reduced by 1 if span is 0 to reflect removal of next element.
 * <p>
 * This anchor position type is used for iterating positions since it ignores
 * insertions into the list immediately after the current position.
 * <p>
 * All offset based operations on this position are operations on the list at index relative to this position's index and span,
 * so offsets may be -ve or +ve as long as absolute index is &gt;=0 and &lt;list.size()
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Offsets are affected by span being 0 or 1 and type of anchor for the position:
 * Offset of 0 refers to the element of this position and is only available if this position span is 1.
 * <p>
 * Offset &lt;0 refer to the elements preceding the element at this position. For {@link PositionAnchor#PREVIOUS} If span is 0 then the offset is
 * increased by 1 to reflect that there is no current element at this position.
 * <p>
 * Offset &gt;0 refer to the elements following the element at this position. If span is 0 then offset is reduced by 1
 * to reflect that there is no current element.
 * <p>
 * PositionList iterator will iterate over list elements while elements
 * are added or removed from the list without affecting count of the iteration as long
 * as elements are only added immediately before or after the current position.
 * <p>
 * This is not limited to adding 1 element. Each added element before or after the current
 * position moves the previous/next element position in the list. The first addition is limited to relative offset of -1, 0 or 1
 * from current index if the addition is not to affect iteration.
 * <p>
 * The following operations can insert anywhere in the previously inserted range.
 * <p>
 * Deletions have no limitations. They can never cause new elements to be inserted after
 * the next element position of the iterator so cannot cause iteration to continue on a newly added element.
 * <p>
 * All this makes list manipulation while traversing it easier to write, debug and understand because
 * all operations are relative to current position instead of a numeric index. In the code you
 * see -1, 0, +1, for previous, current and next element references taking removal and addition of elements into account.
 * <p>
 * PositionList adjusts all outstanding positions into its instance. Allowing getting multiple
 * positions in the list before making modification, in order to track index of elements at those positions.
 * If after modifications the position has 0 span, as reflected by its {@link IPosition#isValidElement()} being
 * false, then the element at that position was removed. Otherwise, getIndex() will return the current
 * index of that element in the list. If there is no valid element will return the index of the position, which
 * will be the next available element in the list.
 * <p>
 * Index computations can be a real bug generator, throw inserting, deleting and traversing a list at the
 * same time and you have a beast to debug and maintenance nightmare to look forward to.
 * PositionList and Position instances make all that go away. That's why I wrote these classes
 * so I don't have to write and debug the same error prone code for manipulating lists.
