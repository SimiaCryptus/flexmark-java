    Provides containment of other format blocks to allow
    inheritance of formatting from parent to child

    Specifically, indentation is combined with that of the parent so that
    child elements are located within the parent's client area.

    Where possible, border is passed into the child but offset to the original
    border provider's location. That way block quote borders are propagated
    to children even if they are indented. However the limit for Word is border
    being 31pt offset from text so not much indenting can be done before the border
    shifts.

    Effectively, the style settings are made explicit if their combination
    differs from the style values.

    Handle containment of P elements in parent, for tables these are
    put into the cell for all others they are added to the document.
